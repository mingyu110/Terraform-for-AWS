### Features

- **Serverless Deployment:** Utilize AWS Serverless Services for a scalable and cost-effective deployment.
- **Full Stack:** Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and Backend (Python) seamlessly integrated.
- **Database:** No SQL Database (DynamoDB) for efficient data storage.

### Frontend

The `Frontend` folder contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files responsible for the user interface and client-side functionalities. Customize these files to match your application's design.

### Backend

The `Backend` folder houses the backend logic written in Python. This includes Lambda functions that handle server-side processing and interactions with AWS services. Modify these files to tailor the backend to your specific needs.
